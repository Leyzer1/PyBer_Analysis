# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Pyber data to find the total count of rides, the total riders, the total fares , the average fare per ride, and lastly the average fare per driver. This analysis was done with pandas and matplotlib to visualize the results. The calculations were gathered on a table data frame and then plotted into line graphs to better understand the results.

# Results

In this scatter bubble chart we can see that Urban city rides have a larger volume of riders, followed by suburban, and lastly rural city type. This chart also shows that rural cities have on average higher fare rates. The reasoning for this would be that people in rural areas have to travel further to get to their destination, compared to Urban cities, where distances can be shorter, while Suburban city type seats in the middle of the pack.

This box plot chart shows us the outliers in our data. We can see an example of this in the urban box plot where a small circle is outside of the upper error bars. This box plot chart shows us where the majority of the volume of rides are concentrated. For urban it is between 21 and 27 rides, for Suburban is between 14 and 19, and lastly for rural is between 5 and 8.

This pie chart shows us that urban type of rides have the largest percentage of total fares followed by suburban and lastly rural.

This pie chart shows us that urban type of rides have the largest percentage of total rides followed by suburban and lastly rural.

This pie chart shows us that Uban city also has the largest number of drivers, this is because urban areas have larger numbers of people compared to suburban and rural cities.

This line graph shows us the summary of total fare by city type throughout the early months of 2019. Urban city types have the higher fare followed by suburban, and lastly rural. In the later dates of February, we see a pike in fare  on all three city types. This could possibly be because people are traveling further or it could be a busier time of the year. 

# Summary

The data shows that larger city types have a larger amount of rides, therefore a larger total fare. The spikes in the summary line chart can help Pyber prepare the following year by getting more drivers during the busy time of the year which seems to be late February.
